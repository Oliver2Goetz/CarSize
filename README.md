# CarSize

CarSize is a Rocket League Plugin which allows you to scale your car in private matches smaller and larger. This Plugin needs bakkesmod in order to run.

## Installation

### Requirements

* The first thing you need is to install [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/ "Bakkesmod")
* To play a custom game with others you need the [Rocket Plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/26)

### Installing the Plugin

You can download the Plugin from the official Bakkesmod-Plugin Website [here](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/271)

### Configuration

The slider lets you set the scaling of the car (default: 1x). By clicking "Apply" the setting will be saved.
> To avoid weird hitbox behaviour I recommend to use a scale between 0.8 and 1.5 inclusive.

For configuration I recommend the following sequense:
1. Setup sizes and enable for team/s
2. Players join teams
3. Pause game with Bakkesmod
4. Players rejoin their team
5. Resume -> Scaling of cars are working fine now

> The host has to be on one of the teams - spectating as host does not work currently!
