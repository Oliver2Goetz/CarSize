# CarSize

CarSize is a Rocket League Plugin which allows you to scale your car in private matches smaller and larger. This Plugin needs bakkesmod in order to run.

## Installation

### Requirements

* The first thing you need is to install [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/ "Bakkesmod")
* To play a custom game with others you need the [Rocket Plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/26)

### Installing the Plugin

Open Bakkesmod ingame via F2 and navigate to the Plugins Tab. Open the Plugin Manager insert the Plugin-ID in the field to the right and click "Install by ID".

### Usage and configuration

The slider lets you set the scaling of the car (default: 1x). By clicking "Apply" the setting will be saved.
> To avoid weird hitbox behaviour I recommend to use a scale between 0.3 and 2.2 inclusive.
